Tweets create a new challenge for named entity recognition (NER). Traditional NER tools have poor performance on tweets. This drop in performance stems from a variety of reasons. Oftentimes, twitter data is written informally, resulting in data that is extremely short and noisy. For example, it often contains many linguistic abnormalities, such as misspellings, non-standard capitalization, abbreviations, and poor grammar. Additionally, it often refers to new products or includes names of new movies or books. Because traditional NER tools are created for text such as journals and articles, which expect correct grammar and formal writing, they do not perform well on Tweets. Our goal is to create a new method in order to improve recognition of named entities on Tweets.
